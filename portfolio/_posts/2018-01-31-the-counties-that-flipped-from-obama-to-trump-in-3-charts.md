Analyzing election results by looking at counties that flipped from one party to another. A developer and a data reporter on the team stitched together current and previous election results along with demographic information, and I worked with the team to sketch out these charts and then design and build them. The maps were originally drawn in D3, but I chose to present them as flat images to keep the page and the flipper animation as lightweight as possible.
